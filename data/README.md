# Data Dictionary

This dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final).
It contains data about a fictitious superstore.  I wanted to keep things simple, so I created a subset of the dataset to perform exploration.

The columns I decided to work with are described below:
    - order date:
        - date an order was placed in the format of YYYY-MM-DD
    - region:
        - region in which the store that fulfilled the sale was located
        - north, south, east, or west
    - product category:
        - the category of item the product falls under
        - technology, Furniture, or office supplies
    - sales:
        - how much money was made when in a sale
    - profit:
        - how much of a profit was made from a sale
